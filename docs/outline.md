# Tutorial:
# Analysis and Visualization of Large Complex Data Sets with Tessera<sup>TM</sup>

**Ryan Hafen, Stephen F Elston, and Amanda White**

## Background:

R is a powerful language for statistical analysis and visualization, with most of its power restricted to data of small or moderate size. Using Tessera, users readily visualize and analyze large complex data sets in a familiar R environment.

Developed over the past two years as part of the DARPA XDATA program, [Tessera](http://tessera.io) is an open source statistical computing environment. Tessera enables R users to perform deep analysis of large, complex data sets. Principal contributors to the project are statisticians and computer scientists at Purdue University and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Tessera uses the Divide and Recombine (D&R) approach. In D&R, data is divided into meaningful subsets, embarrassingly parallel computations are performed on the subsets, and results are combined in a statistically valid manner. Using the R datadr package, Tessera provides a simple interface to distributed parallel back end computation environments such as Hadoop or Spark.  Tessera includes a visualization component, Trelliscope, which provides a D&R approach for detailed, flexible, and interactive visualization of large complex data.

## Tutorial overview:

R users will gain hands-on experience analyzing and visualizing data with Tessera. Using the famous ASA Airline data set, we will demonstrate what Tessera is and how to apply it. Attendees will develop a practical feel for using Tessera for statistical analysis and visualization.

The interactive tutorial examples are small enough to run on an attendee-provided laptop. The techniques learned can be quickly scaled up to a Tessera cluster for larger data sets.
