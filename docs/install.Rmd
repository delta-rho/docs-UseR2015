# Tessera Tutorial at useR! 2015 #

The Tessera team will be presenting an interactive tutorial at [useR! 2015](http://user2015.math.aau.dk) in Aalborg Denmark on June 30, 2015.

## Download Tutorial Materials ##

Participants who would like to download the Tessera tools prior to the tutorial, please follow these instructions. These tools will allow you to use and test Tessera on your own computer without Hadoop or a similar parallel processing backend.

We highly encourage you to install the packages and download the supplementary material prior to the tutorial.

1. If you do not already have the most recent version of R, (version 3.2), please download and install it from here: [http://cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org).

2. Optional: You may find the RStudio development environment an easier way to program in R, but it is not necessary. You may download it here: [http://www.rstudio.com/](http://www.rstudio.com/).

3. You will need the Firefox or Chrome browser installed on your computer.  Internet Explorer and Safari sometimes have problems displaying Trelliscope views.

4. Open R and execute the following commands to install Tessera and other libraries you'll need for the tutorials:

```r
install.packages("maps")
if (!require("devtools"))
    install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tesseradata/datadr")
devtools::install_github("tesseradata/trelliscope")
devtools::install_github("hafen/housingData")
devtools::install_github("bokeh/rbokeh")
```

**For Windows users:**  when installing `devtools`, you may notice the following warning, which you can ignore:

```r
> library(devtools)
WARNING: Rtools is required to build R packages, but no version of Rtools compatible with R 3.x was found. (Only the following incompatible version(s) of Rtools were found:3.2)
Please download and install Rtools 3.1 from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ and then run find_rtools().
```

To test your installation, you can load R and try the following commands:

```r
library(trelliscope)
library(rbokeh)
library(housingData)

panel <- function(x)
  figure() %>% ly_points(time, medListPriceSqft, data = x)

housing %>%
  qtrellis(by = c("county", "state"), panel, layout = c(2, 4))
```

This should bring up an interactive trelliscope display in your web browser.

5. Download the Tessera tutorial supplementary files and unzip them on your computer:
[Tessera_tutorial_UseR2015.zip](http://ml.stat.purdue.edu/user2015/Tessera_tutorial_UseR2015.zip)

6. Download the NYC Taxi sample data and unzip it on your computer: [taxiOneWeek.csv.zip](http://ml.stat.purdue.edu/user2015/taxiOneWeek.csv.zip)

<!-- 6. The zip file contains a folder called **exercises**.  Set your working directory in R to this folder,
using something like `setwd("mypaths/exercises")`.  The **exercises** folder
contains a folder for each of the three exercises:  **power_exercise**, **netflow_exercise**, and **housing_exercise**.
Each exercise folder has a single **.R** file which contains the code for the exercise. Open that
file in your editor of choice and begin! -->

#### We look forward to seeing you at useR!
